# Raw_Buzz_Artwork
Allow the public to see how I took photos of the doll and how those photos were edited so that a transparency color was included.
The BMP images are the static images 365/12 or 30 degrees of motion between each other. This was a good number. The total number of photos taken to render one sprite was 120. The files with the k25 extension are files taken with a Kodak DC25 digital camera.
